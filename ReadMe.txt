This is Pong made using my LWJGL 3D game engine (which can be found on my
GitHub).

The game is in an almost-complete state. The only things that really need to be
added are quality of life aspects like messages displaying the controls and who
wins etc. But, all the functionality of the game is in place and the hearts at
the top of the window correctly display the score.

The controls are as follows:
w - move blue paddle up
s - move blue paddle down
up arrow - move red paddle up
down arrow - move red paddle down
space - un-pause the game (when the game starts and whenever a player loses a
life)
